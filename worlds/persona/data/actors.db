You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.MOk1rkF0DeJlcC4l]{unconscious}.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.

You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.MOk1rkF0DeJlcC4l]{unconscious}.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.

If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature (see the sidebar) instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps <span class=\"No-Break\">you put it on).</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart — in a chaste sort of devotion. (This person could<span class=\"No-Break\"> be your bond.)</span></p>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\"> </div>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>VARIANT FEATURE: RETAINERS</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If your character has a noble background, you may select this background feature instead of Position of Privilege.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body-Last--apply-at-last-paragraph-\">You have the service of three retainers loyal to your family. These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. Your retainers are commoners who can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\"> </div>\n<h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5>\n<p>Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family’s care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.</p>\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d8</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Personality Trait</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td class=\"left wrap\">My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel like the most wonderful and important person in the world.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td class=\"left wrap\">The common folk love me for my kindness and generosity.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td class=\"left wrap\">No one could doubt by looking at my regal bearing that I am a cut above the unwashed masses.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td class=\"left wrap\">I take great pains to always look my best and follow the latest fashions.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td class=\"left wrap\">I don’t like to get my hands dirty, and I won’t be caught dead in unsuitable accommodations.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td class=\"left wrap\">Despite my noble birth, I do not place myself above other folk.

You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p>\n<p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p>\n<p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?</p>\n<p>What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</p>\n<p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time?

You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p>\n<p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p>\n<p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?</p>\n<p>What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</p>\n<p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time?

Through creative innovation and immaculate aim, you become a distant force of death on the battlefield. However, not being a perfect science, firearms carry an inherent instability that can occasionally leave you without a functional means of attack. This is the danger of new, untested technologies in a world where the arcane energies that rule the elements are ever present. </span></p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Firearm Proficiency</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with firearms, allowing you to add your proficiency bonus to attacks made with firearms. </span></p>\n\n<p><b>Gunsmith</b></p>\n<p>Upon choosing this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with Tinker’s Tools. You may use them to craft ammunition at half the cost, repair damaged firearms, or even draft and create new ones (DM’s discretion). Some extremely experimental and intricate firearms are only available through crafting.</p>\n<h5><strong>Firearm Properties</strong></h5>\n<p>Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Firearms are ranged weapons.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Reload.</em></strong> The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Misfire.</strong></em> Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Explosive.</strong></em> Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.</p>\n<h5><strong>Ammunition</strong></h5>\n<p>All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature}, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price.</p>\n<h5>Firearms</h5>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Cost</th>\n<th>Ammo</th>\n<th>Damage</th>\n<th>Weight</th>\n<th>Range</th>\n<th>Properties</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Palm Pistol</td>\n<td>50g</td>\n<td>2g (20)</td>\n<td>1d8 piercing</td>\n<td>1 lb.</td>\n<td>(40/160)</td>\n<td>\n<div>Light, reload 1, misfire 1</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pistol</td>\n<td>150g</td>\n<td>4g (20)</td>\n<td>1d10 piercing</td>\n<td>3 lb.</td>\n<td>(60/240)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Reload 4, misfire 1</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Musket</td>\n<td>300g</td>\n<td>5g (20)</td>\n<td>1d12 piercing</td>\n<td>10 lb.</td>\n<td>(120/480)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Two-handed, reload 1, misfire 2</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pepperbox</td>\n<td>250g</td>\n<td>4g (20)</td>\n<td>1d10 piercing</td>\n<td>5 lb.</td>\n<td>(80/320)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Reload 6, misfire 2</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blunderbuss</td>\n<td>300g</td>\n<td>5g (5)</td>\n<td>2d8 piercing</td>\n<td>10 lb.</td>\n<td>(15/60)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Reload 1, misfire 2</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bad News</td>\n<td>Crafted</td>\n<td>10g (5)</td>\n<td>2d12 piercing</td>\n<td>25 lb.</td>\n<td>(200/800)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Two-handed, reload 1, misfire 3</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hand Mortar</td>\n<td>Crafted</td>\n<td>10g (1)</td>\n<td>2d8 fire</td>\n<td>10 lb.</td>\n<td>(30/60)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Reload 1, misfire 3, explosive</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><b>Adept Marksman</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to perform powerful trick shots to disable or damage your opponents using your firearms.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>Trick Shots.</i></b><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> You learn two trick shots of your choice, which are detailed under “Trick Shots” below.

You regain all expended grit points after a short or long rest.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>Saving Throws.</i></b><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> Some of your trick shots require your targets to make a saving throw to resist the trick shot’s effects.

Firearms are ranged weapons.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Reload.</em></strong> The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Misfire.</strong></em> Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Explosive.</strong></em> Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.</p>\n<h5><strong>Ammunition</strong></h5>\n<p>All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature}, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price.</p>\n<h5>Firearms</h5>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Cost</th>\n<th>Ammo</th>\n<th>Damage</th>\n<th>Weight</th>\n<th>Range</th>\n<th>Properties</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Palm Pistol</td>\n<td>50g</td>\n<td>2g (20)</td>\n<td>1d8 piercing</td>\n<td>1 lb.</td>\n<td>(40/160)</td>\n<td>\n<div>Light, reload 1, misfire 1</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pistol</td>\n<td>150g</td>\n<td>4g (20)</td>\n<td>1d10 piercing</td>\n<td>3 lb.</td>\n<td>(60/240)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Reload 4, misfire 1</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Musket</td>\n<td>300g</td>\n<td>5g (20)</td>\n<td>1d12 piercing</td>\n<td>10 lb.</td>\n<td>(120/480)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Two-handed, reload 1, misfire 2</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pepperbox</td>\n<td>250g</td>\n<td>4g (20)</td>\n<td>1d10 piercing</td>\n<td>5 lb.</td>\n<td>(80/320)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Reload 6, misfire 2</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blunderbuss</td>\n<td>300g</td>\n<td>5g (5)</td>\n<td>2d8 piercing</td>\n<td>10 lb.</td>\n<td>(15/60)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Reload 1, misfire 2</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bad News</td>\n<td>Crafted</td>\n<td>10g (5)</td>\n<td>2d12 piercing</td>\n<td>25 lb.</td>\n<td>(200/800)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Two-handed, reload 1, misfire 3</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hand Mortar</td>\n<td>Crafted</td>\n<td>10g (1)</td>\n<td>2d8 fire</td>\n<td>10 lb.</td>\n<td>(30/60)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Reload 1, misfire 3, explosive</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Fighter : Gunslinger","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":39826,"type":"class","dndbeyond":{"requiredLevel":3,"displayOrder":2,"levelScale":null,"levelScales":[],"limitedUse":[],"class":"Fighter : Gunslinger"},"class":"Fighter","subclass":"Gunslinger","importId":"tmgYzNgnkQZIXXoD"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Fighter"}}},"_id":"R8QTHt51lmnP7wsE","img":"icons/weapons/guns/gun-worn-steel.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"BbAoPCVhec6BLEhX":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1670912237177,"modifiedTime":1670912237177,"lastModifiedBy":"BbAoPCVhec6BLEhX"}},{"name":"Trick Shots: Winging Shot","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">These trick shots are presented in alphabetical order.<br /></span></p><h3>Winging Shot</h3><p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to attempt to topple a moving target.

Most are small-scale operations that employ a dozen to a hundred folk who offer security services, hunt monsters and brigands, or go to war in exchange for gold. Some organizations, such as the Zhentarim, Flaming Fist, and the nation of Mintarn have hundreds or thousands of members and can provide private armies to those with enough funds. A few organizations operating in the North are descri<span class=\"No-Break\">bed below.</span> <br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The Chill.</span></strong> The cold and mysterious Lurkwood serves as the home of numerous groups of goblinoids that have banded together into one tribe called the Chill. Unlike most of their kind, the Chill refrains from raiding the people of the North and maintains relatively good relations so that they can hire themselves out as warriors. Few city-states in the North are willing to field an army alongside the Chill, but several are happy to quietly pay the Chill to battle the Uthgardt, orcs, trolls of the Evermoors, and other threats to civ<span class=\"No-Break\">ilization.</span> <br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Silent Rain.</span></strong> Consisting solely of elves, Silent Rain is a legendary mercenary company operating out of Evereska. Caring little for gold or fame, Silent Rain agrees only to jobs that either promote elven causes or involve destroying orcs, gnolls, and the like. Prospective employers must leave written word (in Elvish) near Evereska, and the Silent Rain sends a representative if i<span class=\"No-Break\">nterested.</span> <br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The Bloodaxes.</span></strong> Founded in Sundabar nearly two centuries ago, the Bloodaxes were originally a group of dwarves outcast from their clans for crimes against the teachings of Moradin Soulforger. They began hiring out as mercenaries to whoever in the North would pay them. Since then the mercenary company has broadened its membership to other races, but every member is an exile, criminal, or misfit of some sort looking for a fresh start and a new family among the bold <span class=\"No-Break\">Bloodaxes.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\"> </div>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Hanging\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skill Proficiencies:</span></strong> Athletics, <span class=\"No-Break\">Persuasion<br /></span><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tool Proficiencies:</span></strong> One type of gaming set, vehic<span class=\"No-Break\">les (land)<br /></span><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Equipment:</span></strong> A uniform of your company (traveler’s clothes in quality), an insignia of your rank, a gaming set of your choice, and a pouch containing the remainder of your last wag<span class=\"No-Break\">es (10 gp)</span></p>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\"> </div>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\"><strong>FEATURE: MERCENARY LIFE</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can.

Some organizations, such as the Zhentarim, Flaming Fist, and the nation of Mintarn have hundreds or thousands of members and can provide private armies to those with enough funds. A few organizations operating in the North are descri<span class=\"No-Break\">bed below.</span> <br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The Chill.</span></strong> The cold and mysterious Lurkwood serves as the home of numerous groups of goblinoids that have banded together into one tribe called the Chill. Unlike most of their kind, the Chill refrains from raiding the people of the North and maintains relatively good relations so that they can hire themselves out as warriors. Few city-states in the North are willing to field an army alongside the Chill, but several are happy to quietly pay the Chill to battle the Uthgardt, orcs, trolls of the Evermoors, and other threats to civ<span class=\"No-Break\">ilization.</span> <br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Silent Rain.</span></strong> Consisting solely of elves, Silent Rain is a legendary mercenary company operating out of Evereska. Caring little for gold or fame, Silent Rain agrees only to jobs that either promote elven causes or involve destroying orcs, gnolls, and the like. Prospective employers must leave written word (in Elvish) near Evereska, and the Silent Rain sends a representative if i<span class=\"No-Break\">nterested.</span> <br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The Bloodaxes.</span></strong> Founded in Sundabar nearly two centuries ago, the Bloodaxes were originally a group of dwarves outcast from their clans for crimes against the teachings of Moradin Soulforger. They began hiring out as mercenaries to whoever in the North would pay them. Since then the mercenary company has broadened its membership to other races, but every member is an exile, criminal, or misfit of some sort looking for a fresh start and a new family among the bold <span class=\"No-Break\">Bloodaxes.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\"> </div>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Hanging\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skill Proficiencies:</span></strong> Athletics, <span class=\"No-Break\">Persuasion<br /></span><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tool Proficiencies:</span></strong> One type of gaming set, vehic<span class=\"No-Break\">les (land)<br /></span><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Equipment:</span></strong> A uniform of your company (traveler’s clothes in quality), an insignia of your rank, a gaming set of your choice, and a pouch containing the remainder of your last wag<span class=\"No-Break\">es (10 gp)</span></p>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\"> </div>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\"><strong>FEATURE: MERCENARY LIFE</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can.

I strayed from my mentor, a priest in his middle years with a soft voice and ring of grey-dappled hair about a balding head, to approach a statue set aside within a shadowed alcove.  It depicted our god in his humanoid form, an elderly man standing strictly at attention, his wild hair hanging as long as his chest length beard, a staff topped with a stern faced sun clutched in his hand.  I knelt, still only fourteen, before this statue and began to pray right then.  The next six years of my acolyte training would be nothing but a blessing, I knew. <br /><em>“The Gleaming Star”, by Bishop Bernard Portis.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Acolytes are those devoted followers of a particular goddess or god who have decided to take on the mantle of the clergy to better serve their chosen deity.  Often no older than teenagers (though some acolytes begin later in their lives) acolytes are trained for a number of years (typically between three to ten) depending on the strictures of their deity's doctrines.  During their time they memorize and study all written materials concerning their deity and their teachings, learn magics (be they healing or harmful) gifted to the acolytes by their deities, and often go out into their community to provide aid to those in need or proselytize the words of their goddess or god.  Though not every acolyte climbs the ranks into full fledged priesthood, many remain highly dedicated to the church and remain to serve as life-long acolytes working closely with the lay community outside the temple walls.</p>\n<p>Recall that acolytes are trained in the arcane ways of their chosen deities.  This being the case, acolytes rarely receive sufficient martial training in comparison to the paladin ranks of the temple (unless expressly dictated otherwise by their deity's teachings).  This being the case, the acolyte is able to unleash some basic divine magic in order to both defend themselves and allies or to call upon their patron deity for aid for injured parties.  Typically expelled in a gleaming shower of golden sparks and dazzlingly vibrant lights, the magic of the gods is truly something special, even at such a base nature.  Spells such as Cure Wounds, Sacred Flame, or Sanctuary are all practiced by acolytes early on into their divine studies.  Acolytes can make handy allies should you be in need of divine protection or a field medic for an injured compatriot.  Be sure to mind your acolyte well, however, as their spellwork can easily be interrupted if they are forced into a melee fight with a band of slavering gnolls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope
