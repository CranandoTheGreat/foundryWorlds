have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. See <a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Spells Rules</span></a> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=1&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Spells Listing</span></a> for the bard spell list.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Cantrips</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spell Slots</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Ability</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{performance} of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</span></p>\n<p><b>Spell save DC </b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</span></p>\n<p><b>Spell attack modifier </b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</span></p>\n<h5><b>Ritual Casting</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Focus</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can use a musical instrument (see the <a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Tools\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Tools</span></a> section) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Bardic Inspiration</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Jack of All Trades</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Song of Rest</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{performance} regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Bard College</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore detailed at the end of the class description or another from the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Player's Handbook</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> or other sources. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Expertise</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Font of Inspiration</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Countercharm</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{performance} that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{frightened} or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{charmed}. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{performance} ends early if you are @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{incapacitated} or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Magical Secrets</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any classes, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You learn two additional spells from any classes at 14th level and again at 18th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Superior Inspiration</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.</span></p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a rapier, (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a longsword, or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">c</span>) any simple weapon</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a diplomat’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an entertainer’s pack</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a lute or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any other musical instrument</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Leather armor and a dagger</li>\n</ul>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 51","identifier":"bard","levels":2,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"7NXFwa1mgUsQ2nLs","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"iQuzTWgOtgaBy1kE","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"bardic-inspiration","type":"dice","scale":{"1":{"n":1,"die":6},"5":{"n":1,"die":8},"10":{"n":1,"die":10},"15":{"n":1,"die":12}}},"value":{},"title":"Bardic Inspiration","icon":""},{"_id":"xyTZqnTVbAxjlRvT","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"song-of-rest","type":"dice","scale":{"2":{"n":1,"die":6},"9":{"n":1,"die":8},"13":{"n":1,"die":10},"17":{"n":1,"die":12}}},"value":{},"title":"Song of Rest","icon":""},{"_id":"vc31v6423jmiex1p","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"inspiration","type":"dice","scale":{"1":{"n":null,"die":6},"5":{"n":null,"die":8},"10":{"n":null,"die":10},"15":{"n":null,"die":12}}},"value":{},"title":"Bardic Inspiration Die","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["dex","cha"],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["ath","acr","slt","ste","arc","his","inv","nat","rel","ani","ins","med","prc","sur","dec","itm","prf","per"],"value":["dec","prc","slt"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"cha"}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":66210017,"definitionId":1,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"spellSlotDivisor":1,"spellCastingAbility":"cha","importId":"45qqEsG4DrjsAQOL"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Bard"}}},"img":"icons/skills/toxins/cup-goblet-poisoned-spilled.webp","effects":[],"_id":"f1GQRsDivpBK1yAR","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"HvFwU8NyHMRPfUiD":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1667957777318,"modifiedTime":1667957777318,"lastModifiedBy":"HvFwU8NyHMRPfUiD"}},{"name":"Draconic Bloodline","type":"subclass","system":{"description":{"value":"<h1>Description</h1><p>Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors.

The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this b<span class=\"No-Break\">ackground.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Evermeet.</span></strong> The fabled elven islands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faerûn. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your<span class=\"No-Break\"> homeland.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faerûn for a purpose that benefits elven culture o<span class=\"No-Break\">r society.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Halruaa.</span></strong> Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faerûn who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can w<span class=\"No-Break\">ork magic.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faerûn for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa’s many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods<span class=\"No-Break\"> of magic.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Kara-Tur.</span></strong> The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faerûn, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of Faerûn likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn’t your true ethnicity, because that’s the blanket term they use for everyone who shares yo<span class=\"No-Break\">ur origin.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faerûn as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission<span class=\"No-Break\"> was over.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Mulhorand.</span></strong> From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is alien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faerûn. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts <span class=\"No-Break\">of Faerûn.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Those who leave behind Mulhorand’s sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of <span class=\"No-Break\">your home.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Sossal.</span></strong> Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed<span class=\"No-Break\"> in white.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek something incredibly <span class=\"No-Break\">important.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Zakhara.</span></strong> As the saying goes among those in Faerûn who know of the place, “To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more.” Of course, you followed an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though it isn’t unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of Faerûn for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as<span class=\"No-Break\"> you have.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might better appreciate your ow<span class=\"No-Break\">n deities.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Underdark.</span></strong> Though your home is physically closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of the race that occupies the place—but you might also have grown up there after being captured and brought below when you wer<span class=\"No-Break\">e a child.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren’t a native, your reason for leaving “home” probably has something to do with getting away from a bad <span class=\"No-Break\">situation.</span></p> <div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\"> </div> <blockquote> <h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Feature: All Eyes on You</h5> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your<span class=\"No-Break\"> homeland.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland a<span class=\"No-Break\">nd people.<br /></span></p> </blockquote> <h5 class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\"> Suggested Characteristics </h5> <table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\"> <thead> <tr> <th>d6</th> <th style=\"text-align:left\">Personality Trait</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>I have different assumptions from those around me concerning personal space, blithely invading others’ space in innocence, or reacting to ignorant invasion of my own.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>I have my own ideas about what is and is not food, and I find the eating habits of those around me fascinating, confusing, or revolting.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>I have a strong code of honor or sense of propriety that others don’t comprehend.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>I express affection or contempt in ways that are unfamiliar to others.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>I begin or end my day with small traditional rituals that are unfamiliar to those around me.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td>Sarcasm and insults are my weapons of choice.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table><div id=\"table-link\">@Compendium[world.ddb-arics-world-tables.Background: Far Traveler:  Suggested Characteristics ]{Open RollTable Background: Far Traveler:  Suggested Characteristics }</div> <table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\"> <thead> <tr> <th>d6</th> <th style=\"text-align:left\">Ideal</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1</td> <td><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Open.</span> I have much to learn from the kindly folk I meet along my way.

Clerics of a god of light are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their gods’ discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.</p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Bonus Cantrip</b></p>\n<p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the light cantrip if you don’t already know it. This cantrip doesn’t count against the number of cleric cantrips you know.</p>\n\n<p><b>Warding Flare</b></p>\n<p>Also at 1st level, you can interpose divine light between yourself and an attacking enemy. When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can’t be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{blinded} is immune to this feature.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity: Radiance of the Dawn</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness sunlight, banishing darkness and dealing radiant damage to your foes.</p>\n<p>As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.</p>\n\n<p><b>Improved Flare</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, you can also use your Warding Flare feature when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you attacks a creature other than you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Potent Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.</p>\n\n<p><b>Corona of Light</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 17th level, you can use your action to activate an aura of sunlight that lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it using another action. You emit bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light 30 feet beyond that. Your enemies in the bright light have disadvantage on saving throws against any spell that deals fire or radiant damage.</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"light-domain","classIdentifier":"cleric","advancement":[],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"subclassDefinitionId":90403610,"id":30,"importId":"rwMJpaIeIqIDxxPC"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Light Domain"}}},"_id":"VxvuFcxD521JmVPI","img":"icons/weapons/swords/sword-broad-serrated-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"8HPIgG6umXtHWs9k":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1667952441123,"modifiedTime":1667952441123,"lastModifiedBy":"8HPIgG6umXtHWs9k"}},{"name":"Cleric","type":"class","system":{"description":{"value":"<h1>Description</h1><p>A priestly champion who wields divine magic in service of a higher power</p>\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family:Roboto Condensed;font-size:14px\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Wisdom<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Wisdom &amp; Charisma</p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d8 per cleric level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span></strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per cleric level after 1st</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor:</span></strong> Light armor, medium armor, shields<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons:</span></strong> Simple weapons<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Wisdom, Charisma<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills:</span></strong> Choose two from @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{History}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Insight}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Medicine}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Persuasion}, and @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Religion}</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Cleric)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=2&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the cleric spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p>\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Domain</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Nature}, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Life domain is detailed at the end of the class description and provides examples of gods associated with it. See the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for details on all the domains.Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Domain Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each domain has a list of spells — its domain spells — that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Destroy Undead</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.</p>\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\"><caption>\n<h5 id=\"DestroyUndeadTable\">Destroy Undead</h5>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Cleric Level</th>\n<th>Destroys Undead of CR …</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>1/2 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>1 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>2 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>3 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>4 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><b>Divine Intervention</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a mace or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a warhammer (if proficient)</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) scale mail, (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) leather armor, or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">c</span>) chain mail (if proficient)</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any simple weapon</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a priest’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">A shield and a holy symbol</li>\n</ul>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules, Player's Handbook pg 60","identifier":"cleric","levels":3,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"ShHxggTfOjKykQl7","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"s51noM9rivGaD0Wb","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"destroy-undead","type":"numeric","scale":{"5":{"value":1},"8":{"value":1},"11":{"value":2},"14":{"value":3},"17":{"value":4}}},"value":{},"title":"Destroy Undead","icon":""},{"_id":"0qejays9aapvinez","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"channel-divinity","type":"number","scale":{"2":{"value":1},"6":{"value":2},"18":{"value":3}}},"value":{},"title":"Channel Divinity Uses","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["his","rel","ins","med","per"],"value":["rel","ins"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"wis"}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":90403610,"definitionId":2,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"spellSlotDivisor":1,"spellCastingAbility":"wis","importId":"rwMJpaIeIqIDxxPC"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Cleric"}}},"_id":"glcjv0HfaWCa1nvy","img":"icons/magic/life/ankh-gold-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"8HPIgG6umXtHWs9k":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1667952441149,"modifiedTime":1667952441149,"lastModifiedBy":"8HPIgG6umXtHWs9k"}},{"name":"Variant Human","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races.

The @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} of this goal depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is without question a vital and honorable endeavor. Faerûn has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have a similar outlook concerning their actions and responsibilities.</p> <p>Though the term “knight” conjures ideas of mounted, heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly orders in Faerûn don’t restrict their membership to such individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren’t limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the order’s cause.</p> <p>The “Knightly Orders of Faerûn” sidebar details several of the orders that are active at present and is designed to help inform your decision about which group you owe allegiance to.</p> <p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Persuasion}, plus one from among @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Arcana}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{History}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Nature}, and @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Religion}, as appropriate for your order</p> <p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of gaming set or musical instrument</p> <p><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</p> <p><strong>Equipment:</strong> One set of traveler’s clothes, a signet, banner or seal representing your place or rank in the order, and a pouch containing 10 gp</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Suggested Characteristics</strong></p> <p>Use the tables for the soldier background in the <a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\"><em>Player’s Handbook</em></a> as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a knight of your order.</p> <p>Your bond almost always involves the order to which you belong (or at least key members of it), and it is highly unusual for a knight’s ideal not to reflect the agenda, sentiment, or philosophy of one’s order.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>KNIGHTLY ORDERS OF FAERÛN</strong></p> <p>Many who rightfully call themselves “knight” earn that title as part of an order in service to a deity, such as Kelemvor’s Eternal Order or Mystra’s Knights of the Mystic Fire. Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faerûn who hear the word “knight” think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly organizations.</p> <p><em><strong>Knights of the Unicorn.</strong></em> The Knights of the Unicorn began as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters of patriar families in Baldur’s Gate. On a lark, they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue’s tenets. Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should be praised for their strengths and comforted in their weaknesses.</p> <p><strong><em>Knights of Myth Drannor.</em></strong> Long ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove Falconhand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great but fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances and friendship between the civilized races of the world and goodly people in order to combat evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the Dalelands, and they’ve begun to spread to the lands beyond. Their members, each accepted by Dove herself, are above all valiant and honest.</p> <p><em><strong>Knights of the Silver Chalice.</strong></em> The Knights of the Silver Chalice was formed by edict of the demigod Siamorphe in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe’s ethos is the nobility’s right and responsibility to rule, and the demigod is incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. By the decree of the Siamorphe at that time, the Knights of the Silver Chalice took it upon themselves to put a proper heir on the throne of Tethyr and reestablish order in that kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most popular knighthood in Tethyr, a nation that has hosted many knighthoods in fealty to the crown.</p> </blockquote><p></p><h2>Knightly Regard</h2><p>You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid from temples and other religious communities of your deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the community—whether a lone settlement or a great nation—that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals, and those who share those ideals.</p><p>This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight in a fight, or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when he or she is being hunted unjustly.</p><h3>Choices</h3><ul><li>History</li><li>Dragonchess Set</li><li>Draconic</li><li>Arcana</li></ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":null,"advancement":[],"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":27,"type":"background","entityTypeId":1669830167,"dndbeyond":{},"importId":"rwMJpaIeIqIDxxPC"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"background"}}},"img":"icons/skills/trades/academics-book-study-purple.webp","_id":"b0DWdOiIt8h1OGAE","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"8HPIgG6umXtHWs9k":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1667952441429,"modifiedTime":1667952441429,"lastModifiedBy":"8HPIgG6umXtHWs9k"}},{"name":"Channel Divinity: Radiance of the Dawn","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"As an action, you can use Channel Divinity and present your holy symbol to dispel any magical darkness within 30 ft.

Until the rage ends, you manifest a natural weapon. It counts as a simple melee weapon for you, and you add your Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with it, as normal.</p>\n<p>You choose the weapon’s form each time you rage:</p>\n<p><strong>Bite.</strong> Your mouth transforms into a bestial muzzle or great mandibles (your choice). It deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you damage a creature with this bite, you regain a number of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus, provided you have less than half your hit points when you hit.</p>\n<p><strong>Claws.</strong> Each of your hands transforms into a claw, which you can use as a weapon if it’s empty. It deals 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you attack with a claw using the Attack action, you can make one additional claw attack as part of the same action.</p>\n<p><strong>Tail.</strong> You grow a lashing, spiny tail, which deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit and has the reach property. If a creature you can see within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to swipe your tail and roll a d8, applying a bonus to your AC equal to the number rolled, potentially causing the attack to miss you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Bestial Soul</b></p>\n<p><em>6th-level Path of the Beast feature</em></p>\n<p>The feral power within you increases, causing the natural weapons of your Form of the Beast to count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>\n<p>You can also alter your form to help you adapt to your surroundings.

When you enter your rage, you can choose a number of other willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of you equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one creature).

You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Defense</b></p>\n<p>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reckless Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Danger Sense</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells.

If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Persistent Rage</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{unconscious} or if you choose to end it.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Indomitable Might</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Primal Champion</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds.

Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in the <a title=\"Weapons\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Weapons\">Weapons</a> section.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: <strong>Flurry of Blows</strong>, <strong>Patient Defense</strong>, and <strong>Step of the Wind</strong>. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Ki save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Flurry of Blows</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Patient Defense</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Step of the Wind</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Monastic Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Deflect Missiles</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slow Fall</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stunning Strike</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Stunned]{stunned} until the end of your next turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki-Empowered Strikes</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">fireball</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stillness of Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Charmed]{charmed} or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Frightened]{frightened}.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during your move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Purity of Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.</p>\n\n<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.</p>\n\n<p><b>Diamond Soul</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.</p>\n\n<p><b>Empty Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Invisible]{invisible} for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">astral projection</span> spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Perfect Self</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.</p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a shortsword or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any simple weapon</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted ParaOverride-7\">10 darts</li>\n</ul>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 76","identifier":"monk","levels":2,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"96kg6o2jc2mylmof","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kdvfjy8htc57e9di","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"martial-arts","type":"dice","scale":{"1":{"n":1,"die":4},"5":{"n":1,"die":6},"11":{"n":1,"die":8},"17":{"n":1,"die":10}}},"value":{},"title":"Martial Arts","icon":""}],"saves":["str","dex"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["acr","ath","his","ins","rel","ste"],"value":["acr","ins"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"ownership":{"default":0,"9xy2ctfjHpL7zOTp":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"w4aO574dBgSsr3LS","name":"Variant Human","type":"feat","img":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/9/387/636327460929201730.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"entityRaceId":9,"version":"2.9.51","baseName":"Human","moreDetailsUrl":"/races/1-human#VariantHuman","baseRaceId":1,"baseRaceName":"Human","fullName":"Variant Human","subRaceShortName":"Variant","isHomebrew":false,"featIds":[],"portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/9/387/636327460929201730.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","importId":"u61rdwjyrsm4c5gu"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"race"}}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races.

These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s myst<span class=\"No-Break\">erious rites.</span></p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Bonus Cantrip</b></p>\n<p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice. This cantrip doesn’t count against the number of druid cantrips you know.</p>\n\n<p><b>Natural Recovery</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature}. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Circle Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land — arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark — and consult the associated list of spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>\n<h5 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\">Arctic</h5>\n<table

You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Perception}) check but can’t decipher it without magic.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Drawing on the divine essence of @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Druid)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=3&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the druid spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature}. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a druidic focus (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#DruidicFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed.</p>\n<h5>Beast Shapes</h5>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-12\">\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">Level</p>\n</th>\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">Max CR</p>\n</th>\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">Limitations</p>\n</th>\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Header--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">Example</p>\n</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\" style=\"text-align:center\">2nd</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">1/4</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">No flying or swimming speed</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">Wolf</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">4th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">1/2</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">No flying speed</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align:center\">Crocodile</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">8th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">1</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\">—</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align:center\">Giant eagle</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\" style=\"text-align:left\"><br />You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{unconscious}, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{unconscious}.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.eVtpEGXjA2tamEIJ]{darkvision}, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Druid Circle</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land detailed at the end of the class description or one from the Player's Handbook or other sources. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.</p>\n\n<p><b>Beast Spells</b></p>\n<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components.</p>\n\n<p><b>Archdruid</b></p>\n<p>At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell.

Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.

For the next 10 minutes, you have advantage on Strength (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Athletics}) and Dexterity (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Acrobatics}) checks; you can carry, push, drag, and lift twice as much weight as normal; and the distance of your long and high jumps increases by 10 feet (this extra distance costs movement as normal).</p>\n<p><em><strong>Inspiring Smite.</strong></em> Immediately after you deal damage to a creature with your Divine Smite feature, you can use your Channel Divinity as a bonus action and distribute temporary hit points to creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you, which can include you. The total number of temporary hit points equals 2d8 + your level in this class, divided among the chosen creatures however you like.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura of Alacrity</b></p>\n<p><em>7th- and 18th-level Oath of Glory feature</em></p>\n<p>You emanate an aura that fills you and your companions with supernatural speed, allowing you to race across a battlefield in formation. Your walking speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, if you aren’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{incapacitated}, the walking speed of any ally who starts their turn within 5 feet of you increases by 10 feet until the end of that turn.</p>\n<p>When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of the aura increases to 10 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Glorious Defense</b></p>\n<p><em>15th-level Oath of Glory feature</em></p>\n<p>You can turn defense into a sudden strike. When you or another creature you can see within 10 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant a bonus to the target’s AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). If the attack misses, you can make one weapon attack against the attacker as part of this reaction, provided the attacker is within your weapon’s range.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Living Legend</b></p>\n<p><em>20th-level Oath of Glory feature</em></p>\n<p>You can empower yourself with the legends—whether true or exaggerated—of your great deeds. As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are blessed with an otherworldly presence, gaining advantage on all Charisma checks.</li>\n<li>Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack and miss, you can cause that attack to hit instead.</li>\n<li>If you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to reroll it.

With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Paladin)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=4&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the paladin spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Smite</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Health</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sacred Oath</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.</p>\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Oath Spells</h4>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity</h4>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura of Protection</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura of Courage</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{frightened} while you are conscious.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Improved Divine Smite</b></p>\n<p>By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cleansing Touch</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura Improvements</b></p>\n<p>At 18th level, the range of your auras increase to 30 feet.</p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a martial weapon and a shield or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) two martial weapons</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) five javelins or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any simple melee weapon</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a priest’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Chain mail and a holy symbol</li>\n</ul>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 82, Mythic Odysseys of Theros pg 29","identifier":"paladin","levels":3,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"M2rym9jIlgktbt9M","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"FSXcYWJmUTiQWKYP","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"aura-of-protection","type":"numeric","scale":{"6":{"value":10},"18":{"value":30}}},"value":{},"title":"Aura of Protection","icon":""},{"_id":"QGLuskuZTOlW56wb","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"aura-of-courage","type":"numeric","scale":{"10":{"value":10},"18":{"value":30}}},"value":{},"title":"Aura of Courage","icon":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":["rel","med"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":100687469,"definitionId":4,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"spellSlotDivisor":2,"spellCastingAbility":"cha","importId":"mWSWv50tlhPVYvrg"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Paladin"}}},"_id":"JY23YWdcaBmdoM4S","img":"icons/skills/melee/weapons-crossed-swords-yellow-teal.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"9DMSt9AxnfNmYswy":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1663198902308,"modifiedTime":1667951066885,"lastModifiedBy":"9DMSt9AxnfNmYswy"}},{"name":"Mark of Sentinel Human","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races.

While warriors with the Mark of Sentinel are among its most elite forces, House Deneith brokers the services of a wide range of soldiers, including Valenar war bands and the goblins of Droaam. Beyond the battlefield, the Defender’s Guild provides exceptional bodyguards for those who can afford their services. House Deneith is also renowned for its Sentinel Marshals, agents who hold the authority to pursue criminals and enforce the law across the length of Khorvaire. The Sentinel Marshals hold the honor of the house in their hands.

With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions.

They seek out planar portals and keep watch over them, venturing to the Inner Planes and the Outer Planes as needed to pursue their foes. These rangers are also friends to any forces in the multiverse — especially benevolent dragons, fey, and elementals — that work to preserve life and the order of the planes.</p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Horizon Walker Magic</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Horizon Walker Spells table.

As an action, you detect the distance and direction to the closest planar portal within 1 mile of you.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">See the “<a title=\"Planar Travel\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#PlanarTravel\">Planar Travel</a>” section in chapter 2 of the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</span> for examples of planar portals.</p>\n\n<p><b>Planar Warrior</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 3rd level, you learn to draw on the energy of the multiverse to augment your attacks.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The next time you hit that creature on this turn with a weapon attack, all damage dealt by the attack becomes force damage, and the creature takes an extra 1d8 force damage from the attack. When you reach 11th level in this class, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ethereal Step</b></p>\n<p>At 7th level, you learn to step through the Ethereal Plane. As a bonus action, you can cast the etherealness spell with this feature, without expending a spell slot, but the spell ends at the end of the current turn.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Distant Strike</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 11th level, you gain the ability to pass between the planes in the blink of an eye. When you take the Attack action, you can teleport up to 10 feet before each attack to an unoccupied space you can see.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you attack at least two different creatures with the action, you can make one additional attack with it against a third creature.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spectral Defense</b></p>\n<p>At 15th level, your ability to move between planes enables you to slip through the planar boundaries to lessen the harm done to you during battle. When you take damage from an attack, you can use your reaction to give yourself resistance to all of that attack’s damage on this turn.</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"horizon-walker","classIdentifier":"ranger","advancement":[{"_id":"yJqUUlL9onkd6Ezk","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"planar-warrior","type":"dice","scale":{"3":{"n":1,"die":8},"11":{"n":2,"die":8}}},"value":{},"title":"Planar Warrior","icon":""}],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"subclassDefinitionId":109510533,"id":109,"importId":"bicmWNohGV1G5c7H"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Horizon Walker"}}},"img":"icons/magic/lightning/bolt-strike-explosion-yellow.webp","effects":[],"_id":"Rl5z0SbZSdHlO9cO","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"HvFwU8NyHMRPfUiD":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663892233808,"modifiedTime":1663892233808,"lastModifiedBy":"HvFwU8NyHMRPfUiD"}},{"name":"Ranger","type":"class","system":{"description":{"value":"<h1>Description</h1><p>A warrior who combats threats on the edges of civilization</p>\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family:Roboto Condensed;font-size:14px\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d10<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Dexterity &amp; Wisdom<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Strength &amp; Dexterity</p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d10 per ranger level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level: </span></strong>10 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per ranger level after 1st</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor: </span></strong>Light armor, medium armor, shields<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Simple weapons, martial weapons<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Strength, Dexterity<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills: </span></strong>Choose three from @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Animal Handling}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Athletics}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Insight}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Investigation}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Nature}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Perception}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Stealth}, and @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Survival}</p>\n\n<p><b>Favored Enemy</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You have advantage on Wisdom (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Survival}) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.</p>\n\n<p><b>Natural Explorer</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. </p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} to cast spells, much as a druid does. See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Ranger)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=5&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the ranger spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spell Slots</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> using either slot.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature}. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n\n<p><b>Ranger Archetype</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: the Hunter that is detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Primeval Awareness</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Land’s Stride</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">entangle</span> spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Stealth}) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Vanish</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Feral Senses</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You are also aware of the location of any @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{invisible} creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{blinded} or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{deafened}.</p>\n\n<p><b>Foe Slayer</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.</p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) scale mail or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) leather armor</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) two shortswords or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) two simple melee weapons</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows</li>\n</ul>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 89, Xanathar's Guide to Everything pg 42","identifier":"ranger","levels":3,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"Lqt3MgM4zVNBi3eK","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["str","dex"],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["ani","ath","ins","inv","nat","prc","ste","sur"],"value":["ins","inv","prc"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"wis"}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":109510533,"definitionId":5,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"spellSlotDivisor":2,"spellCastingAbility":"wis","importId":"bicmWNohGV1G5c7H"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Ranger"}}},"img":"icons/weapons/bows/shortbow-recurve-yellow.webp","effects":[],"_id":"Gg64euaAGisQRZr8","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"HvFwU8NyHMRPfUiD":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663892233834,"modifiedTime":1663892233834,"lastModifiedBy":"HvFwU8NyHMRPfUiD"}},{"name":"Half-Orc","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Some half-orcs rise to become proud leaders of orc communities.

{"_id":"zZwp3ffJn0W4kWxX","name":"Miasma","type":"character","img":"ddb-images/characters/Miasma.png","items":[{"name":"Soulknife","type":"subclass","system":{"description":{"value":"<h1>Description</h1><p>Most assassins strike with physical weapons, and many burglars and spies use thieves’ tools to infiltrate secure locations. In contrast, a Soulknife strikes and infiltrates with the mind, cutting through barriers both physical and psychic. These rogues discover psionic power within themselves and channel it to do their roguish work.</p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Psionic Power</b></p>\n<p><em>3rd-level Soulknife feature</em></p>\n<p>You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. This energy is represented by your Psionic Energy dice, which are each a d6. You have a number of these dice equal to twice your proficiency bonus, and they fuel various psionic powers you have, which are detailed below.</p>\n<p>Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy die they use, as specified in a power’s description, and you can’t use a power if it requires you to use a die when your dice are all expended. You regain all your expended Psionic Energy dice when you finish a long rest. In addition, as a bonus action, you can regain one expended Psionic Energy die, but you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p>When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your Psionic Energy dice increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12). The powers below use your Psionic Energy dice.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Psi-Bolstered Knack.</strong> </em>When your nonpsionic training fails you, your psionic power can help: if you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you can roll one Psionic Energy die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success. You expend the die only if the roll succeeds.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Psychic Whispers.</strong> </em>You can establish telepathic communication between yourself and others—perfect for quiet infiltration. As an action, choose one or more creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus, and then roll one Psionic Energy die. For a number of hours equal to the number rolled, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can’t use this telepathy if it can’t speak any languages, and a creature can end the telepathic connection at any time (no action required). You and the creature don’t need to speak a common language to understand each other.</p>\n<p>The first time you use this power after each long rest, you don’t expend the Psionic Energy die. All other times you use the power, you expend the die.</p>\n\n<p><b>Psychic Blades</b></p>\n<p><em>3rd-level Soulknife feature</em></p>\n<p>You can manifest your psionic power as shimmering blades of psychic energy. Whenever you take the Attack action, you can manifest a psychic blade from your free hand and make the attack with that blade. This magic blade is a simple melee weapon with the finesse and thrown properties. It has a normal range of 60 feet and no long range, and on a hit, it deals psychic damage equal to 1d6 plus the ability modifier you used for the attack roll. The blade vanishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, and it leaves no mark on its target if it deals damage.</p>\n<p>After you attack with the blade, you can make a melee or ranged weapon attack with a second psychic blade as a bonus action on the same turn, provided your other hand is free to create it. The damage die of this bonus attack is 1d4, instead of 1d6.</p>\n\n<p><b>Soul Blades</b></p>\n<p><em>9th-level Soulknife feature </em></p>\n<p>Your Psychic Blades are now an expression of your psi-suffused soul, giving you these powers that use your Psionic Energy dice:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Homing Strikes.</strong></em> If you make an attack roll with your Psychic Blades and miss the target, you can roll one Psionic Energy die and add the number rolled to the attack roll. If this causes the attack to hit, you expend the Psionic Energy die.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Psychic Teleportation.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you manifest one of your Psychic Blades, expend one Psionic Energy die and roll it, and throw the blade at an unoccupied space you can see, up to a number of feet away equal to 10 times the number rolled. You then teleport to that space, and the blade vanishes.</p>\n\n<p><b>Psychic Veil</b></p>\n<p><em>13th-level Soulknife feature </em></p>\n<p>You can weave a veil of psychic static to mask yourself. As an action, you can magically become @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{invisible}, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, for 1 hour or until you dismiss this effect (no action required). This invisibility ends early immediately after you deal damage to a creature or you force a creature to make a saving throw.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to use this feature again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Rend Mind</b></p>\n<p><em>17th-level Soulknife feature </em></p>\n<p>You can sweep your Psychic Blades directly through a creature’s mind.

Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sneak Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{incapacitated}, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p>\n\n<p><b>Thieves’ Cant</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cunning Action</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Roguish Archetype</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Uncanny Dodge</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as an ancient red dragon’s fiery breath or an <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">ice storm</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reliable Talent</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blindsense</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{invisible} creature within 10 feet of you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slippery Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p>\n\n<p><b>Elusive</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{incapacitated}.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stroke of Luck</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a rapier or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a shortsword</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a shortsword</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a burglar’s pack, (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">c</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves’ tools</li>\n</ul>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 94, Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything pg 63","identifier":"rogue","levels":3,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"3akJYpWWpIW3ehkq","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"eHn3HRg85wK89xaZ","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"sneak-attack","type":"dice","scale":{"1":{"n":1,"die":6},"3":{"n":2,"die":6},"5":{"n":3,"die":6},"7":{"n":4,"die":6},"9":{"n":5,"die":6},"11":{"n":6,"die":6},"13":{"n":7,"die":6},"15":{"n":8,"die":6},"17":{"n":9,"die":6},"19":{"n":10,"die":6}}},"value":{},"title":"Sneak Attack","icon":""}],"saves":["dex","int"],"skills":{"number":4,"choices":["acr","ath","dec","ins","itm","inv","prc","prf","per","slt","ste"],"value":["ste","slt","prc","per"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":90002540,"definitionId":12,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"importId":"A7wxR1HNKVPUXLLd"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Rogue"}}},"_id":"vRfTgk2XcEoZINCd","img":"icons/skills/melee/strike-sword-stabbed-brown.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"6YZDSRefQRjuqiQV":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":1663198220919,"modifiedTime":1664505390788,"lastModifiedBy":"6YZDSRefQRjuqiQV"}},{"name":"Half Banshee","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Most people have a fight or flight reaction when they come face to face with a banshee and let’s be honest this is very understandable.

Add alcohol to the mix and sometime when the moon is full and it is “The right time of the month” for the banshee a creature can come into the world that is truly unique, a half banshee. A perfect fusion of DNA from both her parents (Half banshees are always female) these thankfully rare beings tend to be shunned by society as being odd or making people uncomfortable for no reason they can put their finger on. It inevitable leaves half banshees with only three opens. A life of crime, Adventurer’s life, or hiding away in a monastic enclave where they are not judged on their ancestry.
